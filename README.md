# COMP6710 — 25S1 Notes 

The following comments reflect my personal experience in 25S1

### 1. Course Snapshot

- [Course website](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/comp1110/)
  
- 25S1 introduced major changes to both content and assessment.

### 2. Please Skip the Course If You Can

Experienced programmers can apply for credit transfer via [CSS Course credit & exemption](https://systems.anu.edu.au/students/continuing/credit/).

Doing so early may spare you a **extremely painful** first semester.

### 3. About Functional Java

Up until the mid-semester break the teaching is entirely in Functional Java, and Assignments 1 & 2 must be written with it. We will drill recursion heavily and, right at the end, touch on binary trees. 

The mid-semester exam may be solved in regular Java, and because there is no time-complexity requirement, loops are simpler than recursion; the distinction section tests binary-tree questions. 

After the mid-semester the course switches back to regular Java and we will never need Functional Java again, including in the final exam. 

How to juggle writing assignments in “Fava” while privately practising regular Java is something we will have to work out.

### 4. About Code Walk

This semester, having code that compiles and passes the interface tests is essential for both the mid-semester and final exams, but it is not the main criterion for the weekly assignments. 

- Make sure formatting is tidy, and for every assignment follow the six-step Design Recipe on the course website, adding detailed comments such as initial-state annotations, loop-termination explanations, and test descriptions. 

- Write unit tests that achieve full coverage for every method whenever possible. 

- Treat the code-walk presentation with great seriousness—it will strongly influence your assignment mark.

### 5. The Marking Scheme

This semester the graders will only assess the distinction section of any assignment or exam after the non-distinction section has reached 90 % correctness, and the distinction part is not bonus credit. Be mentally prepared for very low continuous marks. Of course, it would be wonderful if the scheme is revised in the new semester.
